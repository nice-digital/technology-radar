# Technology Radar

## What is it?
Our technology radar captures our stance on particular technologies, in relation to solving our business problems.

When we are considering using a technology not yet used at NICE in a project/service, it should be bought to the architecture forum for discussion. This isn't for rubber stamping, but a chance for people to discuss pros and cons, discuss the implications it might have on other tech, and for people who are interested in getting involved to flag this. If we are happy to try it out, it will go into the "assess" category. These technologies should be reviewed as the project matures. 

Technologies move into the "adopt" category when we are happy for them to be the default choice for development. If a technology is in this category, it would not receive much discussion if presented as part of the tech stack for a new project.

The "hold" category is for technologies that we want to specifically warn against using. This is a mix of things that have been assessed and found to be detrimental, or that used to be used at NICE but have been superseded by other technologies. It is not necessary to remove these technologies from existing services, but they must not be used when starting new development. Where relevant we will indicate what should be used instead.

## How do things get added or changed?
If new development is starting, its proposed tech stack and architecture should be bought to the architecture forum for discussion. If any new technologies are proposed and agreed, they will be added to the adopt section.

We will regularly (quarterly?) review the items on the tech radar to see if anything needs to move since the last review. We may also identify new items to be added.

Items should not be added speculatively - there should be a plan for their use at NICE.

## Category definitions
**Hold** - Technologies in hold must no longer be used for new development

**Assess**  - Technologies that we believe may be valuable, and are currently being assessed to understand their value and impact.

**Adopt** - The default choice when selecting technologies
