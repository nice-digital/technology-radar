> **Adopt** - The default choice when selecting technologies
>
> **Assess**  - Technologies that we believe may be valuable, and are currently being assessed to understand their value and impact.
>
> **Hold** - Technologies in hold must no longer be used for new development

## Assess

### Lightweight architectural decision records 
[Lightweight architectural decision records](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records) capture decisions in source control with the application.  This aims to keep documentation in sync with the codebase.  [Here](https://github.com/tddbin/katas/blob/master/docs/adr/000-use-adrs.md) is a simple markdown example. 

### Threat modelling during development
Threat modelling is a risk-based approach to designing secure systems. It is based on identifying threats in order to develop mitigations to them. With cyber security risk increasing we need effective ways to build security into software before penetration testing is undertaken.  We could test out a [simple approach](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-threat-modelling.html).
